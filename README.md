Prevent supply-chain attacks from your third-party GitHub actions!


Scharf identifies & fixes all third-party CI/CD actions used in your Git repositories. It can also create an analytics-friendly report (CSV, JSON) about mutable tags across repositories. In addition, Scharf also provides a quick way to inspect third-party actions by listing available tags and associated commit SHA.

## Why Scharf?

Scharf is a CLI tool to detect and autofix third-party GitHub actions with mutable references.

Scharf helps you maintain a secure development lifecycle by ensuring that all third-party actions are pinned to a specific commit SHA. This approach minimizes risks associated with dependency drifting and unintentional code modifications to third-party GitHub actions.

## Key Features of Scharf

* **Autofix**: Identify & autofix mutable tags in workflows with GitHub third-party actions.
* **Easy SHA Lookup**: Fetch up-to-date SHA/s of a GitHub action without leaving your terminal.
* **Actionable Reports**: Generate detailed JSON & CSV reports to help you quickly identify and remediate insecure references. Works over multiple repositories.
* **Customization**: Look up either in HEAD reference or all branches while generating actionable reports.


## Supported Platforms
1. Linux (available)
2. Mac OSX (available)

## Installation

1. Download binary for your platform from release versions:

https://github.com/cybrota/scharf/releases

or

2. Easy install with below shell script (Requires `Curl` tool):

```sh
curl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybrota/scharf/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Autofix: Auto-fixes vulnerable third-party GitHub actions in a GitHub repository

Navigate to a locally-cloned GitHub repository, and run:

Ex:
```sh
scharf autofix
```

```ascii

## Getting Started with other commands

Scharf comes with two types of commands to assist hardening of GitHub third-party actions.

1. Discovery Commands (audit, find)
2. Remediation Commands(list, lookup)

<hr />

## Discovery Commands

### Audit: Quickly check if your Git repository has any mutable references using `audit` command. This is useful for single repository
Ex:
```sh
scharf audit
```
Sample output:

```ascii
Mutable references found in your GitHub actions. Please replace them to secure your CI from supply chain attacks.
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|        MATCH        |                       FILEPATH                        |             REPLACE WITH SHA             |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| actions/checkout@v4 | /Users/narenyellavula/scharf/.github/workflows/ci.yml | 11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
```

### Find:  Scan across multiple Git repositories and export results to a file. For example, clone all your organization GitHub repositories to a directory (Ex: workspace), and run:

This operation can include all branches in GitHub repositories (default). All branches excludes tags.

Ex Scan all branches:
```sh
scharf find --root=/path/to/workspace
```

This exports results to JSON. To export results to CSV, pass `--out csv` flag:

```sh
scharf find --root /path/to/workspace --out csv
```

Ex Only scan currently set HEAD in workspace repositories
```sh
scharf find --root=/path/to/workspace --head-only
```
<hr />

## Remediation Commands

### List: If you are unsure about a version, list all tags and Commit SHA of a given action (without version)
Ex:
```sh
scharf list tj-actions/changed-files
```

```ascii

### Lookup: If you already know the version, qickly lookup SHA for a third-party GitHub action

Ex:
```sh
scharf lookup actions/checkout@v4 // 11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683

scharf lookup actions/setup-java@main // 3b6c050358614dd082e53cdbc55580431fc4e437

scharf lookup hashicorp/setup-terraform // 852ca175a624bfb8d1f41b0dbcf92b3556fbc25f, pins main branch as default
```

## Integrating Scharf into GitHub Actions to continously audit workflows

Check the custom repository for adding Scharf as a third-party action auditor.

[https://github.com/cybrota/scharf-action](https://github.com/cybrota/scharf-action)

```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683

      - name: Audit GitHub actions
        uses: cybrota/scharf-action@c0d0eb13ca383e5a3ec947d754f61c9e61fab5ba
        with:
          raise-error: true
```

## Why mutable tags in GitHub CI/CD workflows are bad ?

Using mutable references like tag-based or branch-based references in your CI/CD workflows can lead to unexpected changes or potential security vulnerabilities if the referenced action is compromised by malicious actors.

Scharf lets you identify and mitigate against supply-chain attacks similar to "tj-actions/changed-files" compromise occured in March 2025.
